# Power-Rule-Differentiation

# Overview 
This Java program focuses on differentiating polynomials, specifically those with a singular term, consisting of a constant and an exponent. It employs the Power Rule method for differentiating polynomials, which involves multiplying the variable's exponent by the coefficient and then subtracting one from the exponent.

# How it works 
The program computes derivatives for polynomials using the Power Rule. Here's a simplified breakdown of the process: 
Input: A polynomial in the form x^n, where n is the exponent.
Output: The derivative of the input polynomial with respect to x.
The Power Rule states that the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1).
